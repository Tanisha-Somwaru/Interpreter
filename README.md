# Interpreter
This project represents an AWK Interpreter that converts AWK files into tokens using a Lexer, Paser, and Interpreter. Tokens are keywords and operations used inside of AWK code. Lexer takes
lines inside of the AWK file and breaks it down into tokens. Parser takes the tokens and turns them into nodes and sets the nodes into a tree-like structure. Interpreter takes these nodes and
actually executes their functionality.

## Technology Used
